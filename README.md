# StellarCandidateSelector

StellarCandidateSelector is a sophisticated candidate selection algorithm that leverages multi-criteria analysis and machine learning to identify top software engineering candidates. This tool features flexible filtering, score adjustment, and detailed visualizations to streamline the recruitment process.

## Features

- **Flexible Filtering**:
  - Configure criteria and weights via JSON.
  - Filter candidates based on minimum experience and required skills.
- **Machine Learning Integration**:
  - Adjust candidate scores using a linear regression model.
- **Visualization**:
  - Bar chart representation of candidate final scores.
- **Detailed Logging**:
  - Comprehensive logging of the selection process.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The application is written in Python.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: Used for implementing the machine learning model.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing candidate scores.

## Core Logic

- **Flexible Filtering**:
  - Loads selection criteria from a JSON file.
  - Filters candidates based on minimum experience and required skills.
- **Skill Match Score Calculation**:
  - Calculates a skill match score considering required and preferred skills.
- **Machine Learning Score Adjustment**:
  - Uses a linear regression model to adjust candidate scores.
- **Final Score Calculation**:
  - Combines experience, skill match score, and adjusted score with configurable weights.
- **Visualization**:
  - Plots a bar chart of the candidates' final scores for easy comparison.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main files:

- `main.py`: Contains the implementation of the candidate selection logic, including filtering, score calculation, and visualization.
- `criteria.json`: Defines the selection criteria and weights for the candidate evaluation process.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
